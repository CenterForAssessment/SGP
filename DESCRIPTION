Description: Functions to calculate student growth percentiles and percentile growth projections/trajectories for students using large scale, 
        longitudinal assessment data.  Functions use quantile regression to estimate the conditional density associated 
        with each student's achievement history.  Percentile growth projections/trajectories are calculated using the coefficient matrices derived from 
	the quantile regression analyses and specify what percentile growth is required for students to reach future achievement targets.
