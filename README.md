# Overview

The SGP Package is open source software built for the [**R** software environment](https://www.r-project.org/). The classes, functions and data within the SGP package are used to calculate student growth percentiles and percentile growth projections/trajectories using large scale, longitudinal assessment data. Quantile regression is used to estimate the conditional density associated with each student's achievement history. Percentile growth projections/trajectories are calculated using the derived coefficient matrices and show the percentile growth needed to reach future achievement targets.
