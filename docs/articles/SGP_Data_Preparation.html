<p>There a two common formats for representing longitudinal (time
dependent) student assessment data: WIDE and LONG format. For WIDE
format data, each case/row represents a unique student and columns
represent variables associated with the student at different times. For
LONG format data, time dependent data for the student is spread out
across multiple rows in the data set. The <a href="https://centerforassessment.github.io/SGPdata/">SGPdata
package</a>, installed when one installs the SGP package, includes
exemplar WIDE and LONG data sets (sgpData and sgpData_LONG,
respectively) to assist in setting up your data.</p>
<p>Deciding whether to format in WIDE or LONG format is driven by many
conditions. In terms of the analyses that can be performed using the SGP
package, the WIDE data format is used by the lower level functions
<code>studentGrowthPercentiles</code> and
<code>studentGrowthProjections</code> whereas the higher level wrapper
functions utilize the LONG data format. For all but the simplest,
one-off, analyses, you’re likely better off formatting your data in the
LONG format and using the higher level functions. This is particularly
true is you plan on running SGP analyses operationally year after year
where LONG data has numerous preparation and storage benefits over WIDE
data.</p>

<p>Longitudinal data in WIDE format is usually the most “intuitive”
longitudinal format for those new to longitudinal/time-dependent data.
Each row of the data set provides all the data for the individual case
with the variable names indicating what time period the data is from.
Though intuitive, the data is often difficult to work with, particularly
in situations where data is frequently added to the</p>

<p>The Wide data format illustrated by <code>sgpData</code> and utilized
by the SGP package can accomodate any number of occurrences but must
follow a specific column order. Variable names are irrelevant, position
in the data set is what’s important:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first column <em>must</em> provide a unique student
identifier.</li>
<li>The next set of columns <em>must</em> provide the grade level/time
associated with the students assessment occurrences.</li>
<li>The next set of columns <em>must</em> provide the numeric scores
associated with the students assessment occurrences.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>sgpData</code> above, the first column, <em>ID</em>,
provides the unique student identifier. The next 5 columns,
<em>GRADE_2013</em>, <em>GRADE_2014</em>, <em>GRADE_2015</em>,
<em>GRADE_2016</em>, and <em>GRADE_2017</em>, provide the grade level of
the student assessment score in each of the 5 years. The last 5 columns,
<em>SS_2013</em>, <em>SS_2014</em>, <em>SS_2015</em>, <em>SS_2016</em>,
and <em>SS_2017</em>, provide the scale scores associated with the
student in each of the 5 years. In most cases the student does not have
5 years of test data so the data shows the missing value (NA).</p>
<p>Using wide-format data like <code>sgpData</code> with the SGP package
is, in general, straight forward.</p>

<p>We recommend LONG formated data for use with operational analyses.
Managing data in long format is more simple than data in the wide
format. For example, when updating analyses with another year of data,
the data is appended onto the bottom of the currently existing long data
set. All higher level functions in the SGP package are designed for use
with LONG format data. In addition, these functions often assume the
existence of state specific meta-data in the embedded <a href="https://centerforassessment.github.io/SGPstateData/">SGPstateData</a>
meta-data. See the <a href="https://sgp.io/reference/index.html">SGP
package documentation</a> for more comprehensive documentation on how to
use <code>sgpData</code> for SGP calculations.</p>
<p>There are 7 <em>required</em> variables when using LONG data with SGP
analyses: <code>VALID_CASE</code>, <code>CONTENT_AREA</code>,
<code>YEAR</code>, <code>ID</code>, <code>SCALE_SCORE</code>,
<code>GRADE</code> and <code>ACHIEVEMENT_LEVEL</code> (on required if
running student growth projections). <code>LAST_NAME</code> and
<code>FIRST_NAME</code> are required if creating individual level
student growth and achievement plots. All other variables are
demographic/student categorization variables used for creating student
aggregates by the <a href="https://sgp.io/reference/summarizeSGP.html"><code>summarizeSGP</code></a>
function.</p>
<p>The <code>sgpData_LONG</code> data set contains data for 5 years
across 2 content areas (ELA and Mathematics)</p>

<p>The data set <code>sgptData_LONG</code> is an anonymized, panel data
set comprising 8 windows (3 windows annually) of assessment data in LONG
format for 3 content areas (Early Literacy, Mathematics, and Reading).
This data set is similar to the <code>sgpData_LONG</code> data set
without the demographic variables and with an additional
<code>DATE</code> variable indicating the date associated with the
student assessment record.</p>

<p>The data set <code>sgpData_INSTRUCTOR_NUMBER</code> is an anonymized,
student-instructor lookup table that provides insturctor information
associated with each students test record. Note that just as each
teacher can (and will) have more than 1 student associated with them, a
student can have more than one teacher associated with their test
record. That is, multiple teachers could be assigned to the student in a
single content area for a given year.</p>
