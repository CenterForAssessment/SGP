\title{SGP: Student Growth Percentiles & Percentile Growth Trajectories}
\description{
SGP contains classes and functions to calculate student growth percentiles and percentile growth projections/trajectories following methodology found in Betebenner (2008, 2009).
The package contains two primary functions, \code{\link{studentGrowthPercentiles}} and \code{\link{studentGrowthProjections}}, and numerous higher level functions
that make use of them including: \code{\link{prepareSGP}}, \code{\link{analyzeSGP}}, \code{\link{combineSGP}}, \code{\link{summarizeSGP}}, \code{\link{visualizeSGP}} and
\code{\link{outputSGP}}. These functions are used to calculate and visualize student growth percentiles and percentile growth projections/trajectories for students using large scale, 
longitudinal assessment data.  These norm- and criterion-referenced growth values are currently used in a number of states for many purposes including diagnostic and accountability. 
The functions employ quantile regression (using the \code{quantreg} package) to estimate the conditional density for current achievement using each student's achievement history. 
Percentile growth projections/trajectories are calculated using the coefficient matrices derived from the student growth percentile analyses. These quantities
are summarized in a variety of ways to describe student growth. As of the 0.2-0.0 release, the package also includes the graphics functions 
\code{\link{bubblePlot}}, \code{\link{studentGrowthPlot}}, and \code{\link{growthAchievementPlot}} to produce high quality graphical representations associated with the student 
growth percentile analyses.

Calculation of student growth percentiles and percentile growth trajectories/projections is typically performed by grade and subject. Data for growth percentile 
calculation must be specifically formatted.  See \code{\link[SGPdata]{sgpData}} for an example data set. Batch R syntax for performing analyses across all grades and years is 
provided in the examples of the \code{\link{studentGrowthPercentiles}} and \code{\link{studentGrowthProjections}} using the higher level functions 
\code{\link{prepareSGP}}, \code{\link{analyzeSGP}}, \code{\link{combineSGP}}, \code{\link{summarizeSGP}}, and \code{\link{visualizeSGP}}.}
