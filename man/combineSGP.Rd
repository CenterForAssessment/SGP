\title{Combine student data and SGP results}
\description{
  Utility function/exemplar used to merge student long data with results from student growth percentiles and/or student growth projections calculations. Default values of this
  function are designed to be used following use of other utility functions: \code{\link{prepareSGP}} and \code{\link{analyzeSGP}}. Function is integrate with cutscores embedded in
  \code{\link{SGPstateData}} to calculate growth-to-standard targets associated with catch-up/keep-up to proficient status and move-up/stay-up to advanced status. 
}

\usage{
combineSGP(sgp_object,
	state=NULL,
	years=NULL,
	content_areas=NULL,
	sgp.percentiles=TRUE,
        sgp.percentiles.baseline=TRUE,
	sgp.projections.lagged=TRUE,
        sgp.projections.lagged.baseline=TRUE,
	sgp.target.scale.scores=FALSE,
	sgp.target.content_areas=NULL,
	max.sgp.target.years.forward=3,
	update.all.years=FALSE,
	parallel.config=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{sgp_object}{A list containing both \code{Student} (from \code{prepareSGP}) and \code{SGP} (from \code{analyzeSGP}) slots. 
  }
  \item{state}{Acronym for which state is to be used for the lagged projections and growth to standard analyses. Function will try to guess state name from passed \code{sgp_object} is missing.
  }
  \item{years}{A vector of years indicating years of data to merge with \code{@Data}. If missing, merge will use all available years of student growth percentile results.
  }
  \item{content_areas}{A vector of content areas indicating content areas of student growth percentile data to merge with \code{@Data}. If missing, merge will use all available content areas of
student growth percentile results.
  }
  \item{sgp.percentiles}{A boolean variable indicating whether to combine student growth percentiles.
  }
  \item{sgp.percentiles.baseline}{A boolean variable indicating whether to combine baseline student growth percentiles.
  }
  \item{sgp.projections.lagged}{A boolean variable indicating whether to combine lagged student growth projections and calculate catch-up/keep-up and move-up/stay-up values.
  }
  \item{sgp.projections.lagged.baseline}{A boolean variable indicating whether to combine lagged baseline student growth projections and calculate catch-up/keep-up move-up/stay-up values.
  }
  \item{sgp.target.scale.scores}{A boolean variable indicating whether targets from calculated scale scores should be calculated following target calculation.
  }
  \item{sgp.target.content_areas}{A boolean variable indicating whether content area associated with SGP targets should be calculated.
  }
  \item{max.sgp.target.years.forward}{A integer indicating the number of years forward from the lagged (last year's) score to project forward for growth to standard calculations. Default is 3 years from the present, 4 years from the lagged year, which is the standard in most growth to standard calculations used by state departments of education.
  }
  \item{update.all.years}{A boolean argument defaulting to FALSE indicating whether \code{combineSGP} should delete previously merged variables calculated in \code{\link{analyzeSGP}} and 
re-merge all available data.
  }
  \item{parallel.config}{Parallel configuration only used when 'sgp.target.scale.scores' is set to TRUE. Default is NULL consistent with no targets being calculated. To utilize parallel processing
  in the calculation of SGP scale score targets user must specify a list designating a backend (e.g, BACKEND='PARALLEL') and a number of workers (e.g., 'WORKERS=list(SGP_SCALE_SCORE_TARGETS=4').
  }
}

\value{Function returns a list containing the input long data set in the \code{Student} slot as a \code{data.table} keyed using \code{VALID_CASE}, \code{CONTENT_AREA}, 
\code{YEAR}, \code{ID} merged with student growth percentiles and/or lagged projection targets and catch-up/keep-up and move-up/stay-up status.
