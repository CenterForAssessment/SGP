\title{Summarize student scale scores, proficiency levels and student growth percentiles according to user specified summary group variables}
\description{
 Utility function used to produce summary tables using long formatted data that contain student growth percentiles.  An exemplar is provided from the successive execution of \code{\link{prepareSGP}}, \code{\link{analyzeSGP}} and \code{\link{combineSGP}}.
}

\usage{
summarizeSGP(sgp_object,
           state,
           years,
           content_areas,
           sgp.summaries=NULL,
           summary.groups=NULL,
           confidence.interval.groups=NULL,
           produce.all.summary.tables=FALSE,
           summarizeSGP.baseline=NULL,
           projection.years.for.target=3,
           save.old.summaries=FALSE,
	   highest.level.summary.grouping="STATE",
           parallel.config=NULL) 
}

\arguments{
  \item{sgp_object}{A list containing long formatted data in the \code{@Data} slot. If summaries of student growth percentiles are requested, those quantities must first be produced (possibly by first using \code{\link{analyzeSGP}}) and subsequently combined with the \code{@Data} data (possibly with \code{\link{combineSGP}}).
  }
  \item{state}{Acronym indicating state associated with the summaries for access to assessment program information embedded in \code{SGPstateData}.
  }
  \item{years}{A vector indicating year(s) in which to produce summary tables associated with student growth percentile and percentile growth trajectory/projection analyses. If missing the
function will use the data to calculate years and produce summaries for the most recent three years.
  }
  \item{content_areas}{A vector indicating content area(s) in which to produce student growth percentiles and/or student growth projections/trajectories. 
If missing the function will use the data to infer the content area(s) available for analyses.
  }
  \item{sgp.summaries}{A list giving the summaries requested for each group analyzed based upon the \code{summary.group} argument. The default (produced internal to summarizeSGP) summaries include:
\tabular{ll}{
\code{MEDIAN_SGP} \tab The group level median student growth percentile.\cr 
\code{MEDIAN_SGP_COUNT} \tab The number of students used to compute the median.\cr 
\code{PERCENT_AT_ABOVE_PROFICIENT} \tab The percentage of students at or above proficient.\cr 
\code{PERCENT_AT_ABOVE_PROFICIENT_COUNT} \tab The number of students used to compute the percentage at/above proficient.\cr 
\code{PERCENT_AT_ABOVE_PROFICIENT_PRIOR} \tab The percentage of students at or above proficient in the prior year.\cr 
\code{PERCENT_AT_ABOVE_PROFICIENT_PRIOR_COUNT} \tab The number of students used to compute the percentage at/above proficient in the prior year.\cr 
}
NOTE: The internal function \code{percent_in_category()} summary function requires a variable that MUST be a factor with proficiency categories as levels. The function utilizes the SGPstateData
with the provided state name in an attempt to identify achievement levels and whether or not they are considered proficient. 
  }
  \item{summary.groups}{A list consisting of 8 elements indicating the types of groups across which all summaries are taken (Inclusion means that summaries will be calculated for levels of the 
associated variable). For state data, if the list is not explicitly provided, the function will attempt to determine levels based upon meta data supplied in the \code{@Names} slot of the provided
SGP object. See \code{\link{prepareSGP}} for more information on supplied meta-data.  
\tabular{ll}{
\code{institution}: \tab State, District and/or School.\cr 
\code{content area}: \tab Variable indicating content area (default is CONTENT_AREA) if content area summaries are of interest.\cr 
\code{time}: \tab Variable indicating time (default is YEAR) if time summaries are of interest. NOTE: Cross year (i.e., multi-year) summaries default to 3 years.\cr 
\code{institution_type}: \tab Variable(s) indicating the type of institution institution (default EMH_LEVEL) if summaries by institution type is of interest.\cr
\code{institution_level}: \tab Variable(s) indicating levels within the institution (default GRADE) if summaries by institution level is of interest.\cr
\code{demographic}: \tab  Demographics variables if summaries by demographic subgroup are of interest.\cr 
\code{institution_inclusion}: \tab Variables indicating inclusion for institutional calculations.\cr 
\code{growth_only_summary}: \tab Variables indicating whether to calculate summaries only for those students with growth in addition to other analyses.\cr
}
All group slots MUST be included in the list, although \code{NULL} can be provided if a grouping subset is not desired. All possible combinations of the group variables are produced. 
  }
  \item{confidence.interval.groups}{A list consisting of information used to calculate group confidence intervals: 
\tabular{ll}{
\code{TYPE}: \tab Either \code{Bootstrap} (default) or \code{CSEM} indicating Bootstrap confidence interval calculation (the default) or conditional standard error of measurement based confidence interval calculation (experimental).\cr 
\code{VARIABLES}: \tab The variables on which to calculate confidence intervals (default is SGP).\cr 
\code{QUANTILES} \tab The desired confidence quantiles.\cr 
\code{GROUP} \tab The group summaries for which confidence intervals should be constructed.\cr
\code{content} \tab The content area variable if confidence intervals by content area are desired.\cr
\code{time} \tab The time variable (default is YEAR) if confidence intervals by time period are desired.\cr
\code{institution_type} \tab The institution type variables (e.g., EMH_LEVEL, default is EMH_LEVEL) if confidence intervals by institution level are desired.\cr
\code{institution_level} \tab The institution level variables (e.g., GRADE, default is NULL) if confidence intervals by institution level are desired.\cr
\code{demographic} \tab The demographic variables if confidence intervals by demographic subgroups are desired.\cr
\code{institution_inclusion} \tab The institution inclusion variables if confidence intervals by institution inclusion subgroups are desired.\cr
\code{growth_only_summary} The growth only summary variables if confidence intervals by growth only summary group are desired.\cr
}
For \code{CSEM} analysis this argument requires that simulated SGPs have been produced (see \code{\link{analyzeSGP}} for more information). List slots set to \code{NULL} will not produce confidence intervals. NOTE: This is currently an experimental functionality and is very memory intensive. Groups to be included should be identified selectively! The default 95\% confidence intervals are provided in the selected summary tables as two additional columns named \code{LOWER_MEDIAN_SGP_95_CONF_BOUND} and \code{UPPER_MEDIAN_SGP_95_CONF_BOUND}. 
  }
\item{produce.all.summary.tables}{A Boolean variable, defaults to FALSE, indicating whether the function should produce ALL possible summary table. By default, a set of approximately 70 tables are produced that are used in other parts of the packages (e.g., bubblePlots).}
\item{summarizeSGP.baseline}{A Boolean variable, defaults to FALSE, indicating whether the function should utilize baseline sgp for summary table production. By default, 
a set of approximately 100 tables are produced that are used in other parts of the packages (e.g., bubblePlots).}
\item{projection.years.for.target}{An integer argument indicating \code{SGP_TARGET} variables to summarize based upon years projected forward. Default is 3 years which is what is generally used by
most states.
}
\item{save.old.summaries}{A Boolean argument, defaults to FALSE, indicating whether to save the \code{@Summary} slot (if not NULL) prior to calculating new summaries. By defaulting to FALSE, the function
overwrites previous (e.g., last year's summaries) summaries.
}
\item{highest.level.summary.grouping}{A character vector indicating the highest level for summary groups, defaults to 'STATE'.
}
 \item{parallel.config}{A named list with, at a minimum, two elements indicating 1) the BACKEND package to be used for parallel computation and 2) the WORKERS list to specify the number of processors to be used in each major analysis.  The BACKEND element can be set = to \code{FOREACH} or \code{PARALLEL}.  Please consult the manuals and vignettes for information of these packages!  The \code{\link{analyzeSGP}} help page contains more thorough explanation and examples of the \code{parallel.config} setup. 

TYPE is a third element of the \code{parallel.config} list that provides necessary information when using FOREACH or PARALLEL packages as the backend. With BACKEND="FOREACH",  the TYPE element specifies the flavor of 'foreach' backend.  As of version 1.0-1.0, only "doParallel" is supported.  TYPE=NA (default) produces summaries sequentially.  If BACKEND = "PARALLEL", the \code{parallel} package will be used.  This package combines deprecated parallel packages \code{snow} and \code{multicore}.  Using the "snow" implementation of \code{parallel} the function will create a cluster object based on the TYPE element specified and the number of workers requested (see WORKERS list description below).  The TYPE element indicates the users preferred cluster type (either "SOCK" for socket cluster of "MPI" for an OpenMPI cluster). If Windows is the operating system, this "snow" implementation must be use and the TYPE element must = "SOCK".  Defaults are assigned based on operating system if TYPE is missing based on system OS.  Unix/Mac OS defaults to the "multicore" to avoid worker node pre-scheduling and appears to be more efficient in these operating systems. 

The WORKERS element is a list with SUMMARY specifying the number of processors (nodes) desired or available.  For example, SUMMARY=2 may be used on a dual core machine to use both cores available. (NOTE: choice of the number of cores is a balance between the number of processors available and the amount of RAM a system has; each system will be different and may require some adjustment).

Default is FOREACH as the back end, TYPE=NA and WORKERS=1, which produces summary tables sequentially: 'list(BACKEND="FOREACH", TYPE=NA, WORKERS=list(SUMMARY=1))' 

Example parallel use cases are provided below.

}

\details{Function makes use of the \code{foreach} package to parallel process summary tables of student data. The proper choice of parallel backend is dependent upon the user's operating system, software and system memory capacity. Please see the \code{foreach} documentation for details. By default, the function will process the summary tables sequentially.
}

\value{Function returns lists containing the summary tables as data.table objects in the \code{@Summary} slot of the SGP data object. Each \code{institution} has a slot in the \code{@Summary} list.

###  Example uses of the parallel.config argument

##  Windows users  must use the parallel package and R version >= 2.13:
#  Note the number of workers is 8, and SOCK type cluster is used.
#  This example is would be good for a single workstation with 8 cores.
	. . .
	parallel.config=list(
		BACKEND="PARALLEL", TYPE="SOCK",
		WORKERS=list(SUMMARY=2))
	. . .

#  doParallel package - only available with R 2.13 or newer
	. . .
	parallel.config=list(
		BACKEND="FOREACH", TYPE="doParallel", 
		WORKERS=list(SUMMARY=6))
	. . .

##  parallel package - only available with R 2.13 or newer
#  Note the number of workers is 50, and MPI is used, 
#  suggesting this example is for a HPC cluster usage.
	. . .
	parallel.config=list(
		BACKEND="PARALLEL", TYPE="MPI"),
		WORKERS=list(SUMMARY=50))
	. . .

#  NOTE:  This list of parallel.config specifications is NOT exhaustive.
