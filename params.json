{"name":"SGP: Student Growth Percentiles","body":"The SGP Package \r\n===============\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Growth Percentiles & Percentile Growth Trajectories/Projections\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe **SGP** Package (SGP, 2012) is an open source package built for the open source **R** software environment (R Development Core Team, 2012). The classes, functions and data within the **SGP** package are used to calculate student growth percentiles and percentile growth projections/trajectories using large scale, longitudinal assessment data. The methodology uses quantile regression to estimate the conditional density associated associated with each student's achievement history. Percentile growth projections/trajectories are calculated using the coefficient matrices derived from the quantile regression analyses and specify the percentile growth required for students to reach future achievement targets.\r\n\r\n* Web site: http://SchoolView.github.com/SGP/\r\n* CRAN Web site: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SGP/\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall stable CRAN release\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n```R \r\ninstall.packages(\"SGP\")\r\nrequire(SGP)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall latest development release from Github\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```R \r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nrequire(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"SGP\", \"SchoolView\")\r\nrequire(SGP)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install from Github you might need: Windows: Rtools (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), OS X: xcode (from the app store),\r\nLinux: apt-get install r-base-dev (or similar).\r\n\r\nAnalysis of data utilizing the **SGP** methodology requires, broadly, two steps: Data Preparation and Data Analysis with these two steps consisting of several substeps:\r\n\r\n* Data Preparation\r\n\t* Preparation of data into *LONG* format.\r\n* Data Analysis\r\n\t* prepareSGP\r\n    * analyzeSGP\r\n    * combineSGP\r\n    * summarizeSGP\r\n    * visualizeSGP\r\n    * outputSGP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData Preparation\r\n================\r\n\r\nThe following provides thorough **SGP** data formatting/preparation specifications for\r\nutilizing the utility function of the package (SGP:2012). To help\r\nillustrate these specifications there is an embedded data set, , within\r\nthe package. The development team uses this data set frequently to test\r\nnew features included in the package. Ensuring your data is set up in\r\nthe proper format will minimize later efforts to run analyses. The goal,\r\nif you supply properly formatted data, is to make generation of student\r\ngrowth data and associated visualizations as easy as *abc*.\r\n\r\n\r\nData must be in long format\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThe first and most fundamental requirement for the data is that it must\r\nbe in long, as opposed to wide, format. For our purposes, this means\r\nthat each row represents a unique *student* by *content area* by *year*\r\ncombination. This uniqueness is relaxed somewhat with the addition of a\r\n`VALID_CASE` variable that defines which case is unique if there are\r\nduplicate records by student, content area and year. Thus, in the final\r\nlong file, each student, by content area by year by valid case\r\nidentifier must be unique. By contrast, a row in the wide data format\r\nwould contain all available information for a single student. For\r\nexample, here are the first four rows (only the first 8 columns) of the\r\nsample data:\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> sgpData_LONG[1:4,1:7]\r\nID LAST_NAME FIRST_NAME CONTENT_AREA   YEAR GRADE SCALE_SCORE\r\n1 1000079   Nixon  Daniela MATHEMATICS 2006_2007   8     463\r\n2 1000079   Nixon  Daniela MATHEMATICS 2007_2008   9     519\r\n3 1000079   Nixon  Daniela   READING 2006_2007   8     587\r\n4 1000079   Nixon  Daniela   READING 2007_2008   9     614\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the same student is in each row, but that the rows represent\r\ndifferent grades and content area combinations. This is what is meant by *long* formatted data.\r\n\r\nRequired Variables\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThe following list gives the columns that are requires for the\r\ncalculation of Student Growth Percentiles and how they should be\r\nformatted (if applicable).\r\n\r\n-   `ID` This column contains the unique student identifiers. Values will be set to\r\n\tclass *character*.\r\n\r\n-   `CONTENT_AREA` This column describes the content area for a given\r\n    row. Most datasets would presumably contain *MATHEMATICS* and\r\n    *READING*, but other values are possible. These values must be\r\n    capitalized and match the states’ assessment information contained\r\n    in the **SGPstateData** object that comes embedded within the **SGP** package.\r\n    Please contact @dbetebenner to have assessment data added to this\r\n    object. These values should be of class *character*.\r\n\r\n-   `YEAR` This column gives either the academic year (e.g., *2006_2007*\r\n    as in the sample data) or the year in which the assessment took\r\n    place (e.g., *2007*). If the latter form is used, the class of this\r\n    column should be set to *integer*. Hyphens may NOT be used (e.g.,\r\n    *2006-07*).\r\n\r\n-   `GRADE` The grade in which the assessment was administered. The\r\n    column of this class should be set to *integer*.\r\n\r\n-   `SCALE_SCORE` The assessment scale score for each observation. This\r\n    column’s class should be set to *integer* or *numeric*.\r\n\r\n-   `VALID_CASE` This column identifies those students who should be\r\n    included in subsequent analyses (value set to *VALID_CASE*) and\r\n    those that should not be included (value set to *INVALID_CASE*.\r\n    Duplicate cases are often left in the data and flagged as an\r\n    *INVALID_CASE*.\r\n\r\nSecondary Columns\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAlthough these columns are not required for Growth Percentile analyses,\r\nthey are required for Growth to Standard analyses, and/or the\r\nvisualization and reporting functionality:\r\n\r\n-   `ACHIEVEMENT_LEVEL` The achievement or proficiency category\r\n    associated with each observed scale score. Values in this column\r\n    should be set to *factor*, and should match the assessment program\r\n    information included in contained in the *SGPstateData* object.\r\n    `ACHIEVEMENT_LEVEL` should be a *factor*.\r\n\r\n-   `FIRST_NAME` Student first name. A *character* or a *factor*.\r\n\r\n-   `LAST_NAME` Student last name. A *character* or a *factor*.\r\n\r\n-   `SCHOOL_NUMBER` Unique identifier for the school/institution in\r\n    which a student is enrolled in a given year. Either an *integer* or\r\n    *factor*.\r\n\r\n-   `SCHOOL_NAME` Name of the school/institution in which a student is\r\n    enrolled in a given year. A character string or `factor`.\r\n\r\n-   `DISTRICT_NUMBER` A unique identifier for the district/educational\r\n    authority in which a student is enrolled in a given year. Either a\r\n    `factor` or `integer`.\r\n\r\n-   `DISTRICT_NAME` District/educational authority name in which a\r\n    student is enrolled in a given year. A character string or `factor`.\r\n\r\n-   `STATE_ENROLLMENT_STATUS` Binary indicator of whether the student\r\n    was continuously enrolled in the state and should be included in\r\n    summary statistics. Indicator must be a `factor`, preferably with\r\n    informative labels such as those in ; `Enrolled State: Yes` and\r\n    `Enrolled State: No`.\r\n\r\n-   `DISTRICT_ENROLLMENT_STATUS` Binary indicator of whether the student\r\n    was continuously enrolled and should be included in district summary\r\n    statistics. Indicator must be a `factor`, preferably with\r\n    informative labels such as those in ; `Enrolled District: Yes` and\r\n    `Enrolled District: No`.\r\n\r\n-   `SCHOOL_ENROLLMENT_STATUS` Binary indicator of whether the student\r\n    was continuously enrolled and should be included in school summary\r\n    statistics. Indicator must be a `factor`, preferably with\r\n    informative labels such as those in ; `Enrolled School: Yes` and\r\n    `Enrolled School: No`.\r\n\r\n-   `GENDER` DO WE WANT THIS AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS? USER CAN CHANGE\r\n    SUMMARY GROUPS IN summarizeSGP.\r\n\r\n-   `ETHNICITY` Ethnicity needed for randomNames, so maybe\r\n    these two...\r\n\r\nA number of other demographic variables can be provided when creating\r\nsummaries.\r\n\r\nVariable Name Lookup Table\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nIf a user does not wish to rename the columns in their data to match the\r\nconventions used in the `SGP` package listed above, the\r\n`Variable_Lookup_Table` option can be used. The user must supply an\r\nappropriate list of variable names in the `var.names` argument of the\r\n`prepareSGP` function. For example, if a state has a unique student\r\nidentifier named \\`\\`My\\_Student\\_ID\" and an assessment subject variable\r\nnamed \\`\\`My\\_Subject\" (all other variable names match), an example call\r\nto `prepareSGP` would include this argument:\r\n\r\n    My_State_Data <- prepareSGP(..., \r\n       var.names=list(ID=\"MyStudent_ID\", CONTENT_AREA=\"My_Subject\"))\r\n\r\nThe `var.names` list *must* include all required columns that do not\r\nmatch the conventions, as well as all secondary columns needed for\r\nsummarization and reporting.\r\n\r\nData Analysis\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nOnce a dataset is properly formatted, a comprehensive analysis can be\r\nconducted using **abcSGP**. An example of the call using the sample data\r\nis below.\r\n\r\n    Demonstration_SGP <- abcSGP(sgpData_LONG)\r\n\r\nThis call returns an object of class *SGP* named `Demonstration_SGP` object which contains student growth percentiles and other information, but it also produces goodness of fit and visualization folders containing files on those two topics.\r\nThe function accepts multiple arguments detailed in the \r\n[documentation](https://github.com/dbetebenner/SGP/blob/master/man/abcSGP.Rd).\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\n------------\r\n\r\nBetebenner, D.
